                        I am the spirit of the city of Johannesburg, you can call me Jozi. I have this strange ability to randomly enter people's bodies but I control who I inhabit. I can experience their thoughts, actions and senses just for a few hours. And I'm here to tell you about my weird and wonderful-ish experiences living the lives of my inhabitants. I also have a huge interest in the history of Johannesburg, as one would expect, and I would like to share that interest with you. Sit back, grab some popcorn and enjoy the exploration of my webpage. (NB! Be careful not to mess your devices with the popcorn flavouring).

The story revolves around the idea of all possible outcomes of quantum measurements being realized in the physical world, this is known as the many-worlds interpretation (MWI). Borges’ take on this theory has inspired many new media scholars... </p> -->

Where this information is found, stored, and created shapes how different parts of the world are understood. Information exists in a material place and is ever evolving and being shaped at that specific location. They start by speaking about space and place and how different groups of people across the globe are trying to impose their narratives of informational augmentations. Who are these people? Why are they the “dominant” force that speaks for others?...  </p>

We always say that we want to be an older self that would make our younger selves proud of and look up to. So here we have Jozi’s younger self looking at the older version of himself, that being the present day we live in, and writing about what he has become, what is he proud of and what he is ashamed of, what he is like today compared to what he dreamed of becoming, these types of things. To do this he has created a character profile website on which he will share his thoughts in the form of blog posts and provide interesting pieces of historical information he (the city) has gone through...</p> -->

It’s a bit dry. I have the urge to stay in bed, but I also desperately need the bathroom. 15 minutes in and I’m still in bed but my alarm is giving me a headache, so I eventually wake up. Bathroom duties occur as per usual. I brush my teeth and look in the mirror. I’m a 20-year-old girl, apparently… Wait, am I?... My reflection in the mirror looks like a boy, but my body parts say otherwise. So, I’m a confused 20-year-old girl lol...</p>
