                        I am the embodiment of the spirit of the city of Johannesburg, you can call me Jozi. One morning I woke up to find myself 40 years in the future, the modern day Johannesburg. I've been given the rare opportunity to see what I become in the future. People often wonder if they're younger self would be proud of who they had become, and I have the chance to find the answer. I'm a young spirit of Jozi living in an older, very different Jozi, and this is my website.
