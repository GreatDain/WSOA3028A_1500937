                    ‘The Garden of Forking Paths’ is a short story written in 1941 by the writer and poet Jorge Luis Borges. The story revolves around the idea of all possible outcomes of quantum measurements being realized in the physical world, this is known as the many-worlds interpretation (MWI). Borges’ take on this theory has inspired many new media scholars.

                    Borges introduces multiple streams produced from a single path that converge back into one stream at the end of the story. This is an interesting concept as it allows readers to take their own decisive journey in the story and ultimately ending up at the same outcome by the end of it. The main plot is the story of a Chinese national named Yu Tsun, in the United Kingdom during World War I, trying to escape from one Richard Madden who is attempting to capture him. Along with this single journey the reader finds themselves on, Borges introduces many other paths which throw the reader off their original course. The reader becomes forced to decide which path they want to keep track of, but all possibilities end up occurring just at different times. This style of writing causes much confusion in the reader throughout and still find your way back on track despite the distractions.

                    It shows that even though different decisions can and will be made, all possible outcomes that could arise from that point can and will occur at some point in time and that regardless of these decisions you will still end up at the same point at some time in the future. This maze of a short story is quite literally a garden of forking paths.
