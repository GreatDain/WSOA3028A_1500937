                    Character Description - 17.02.2020
                </h1>
                    <p>
                        My character, named Jozi, is quite literally meant to be the personification of the city of Johannesburg during the city’s most successful time. We always say that we want to be an older self that would make our younger selves proud of and look up to. So here we have Jozi’s younger self looking at the older version of himself, that being the present day we live in, and writing about what he has become, what is he proud of and what he is ashamed of, what he is like today compared to what he dreamed of becoming, these types of things. To do this he has created a character profile website on which he will share his thoughts in the form of blog posts and provide interesting pieces of historical information he (the city) has gone through. 
                    </p>

                        Jozi is a well-educated, businessman that is quite upfront but still very relaxed and approachable. He has many personalities, all defined by the different areas of Johannesburg. He is a colourful and upbeat person even though his line of work doesn’t allow for much creativity, this has caused him to be very specific and meticulous but also quite laidback and vibrant. He is very confusing due to his mood changes and multiple personalities, but in every personality, he prefers for things to be organized but also colourful and stylish.
