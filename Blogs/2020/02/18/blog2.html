                        My character, named Jozi, is quite literally meant to be the personification of the city of Johannesburg during the city’s most successful time. We always say that we want to be an older self that would make our younger selves proud of and look up to. So here we have Jozi’s younger self looking at the older version of himself, that being the present day we live in, and writing about what he has become, what is he proud of and what he is ashamed of, what he is like today compared to what he dreamed of becoming, these types of things. To do this he has created a character profile website on which he will share his thoughts in the form of blog posts and provide interesting pieces of historical information he (the city) has gone through. 
                    </p>

                        Jozi is a well-educated, businessman that is quite upfront but still very relaxed and approachable. He has many personalities, all defined by the different areas of Johannesburg. He is a colourful and upbeat person even though his line of work doesn’t allow for much creativity, this has caused him to be very specific and meticulous but also quite laidback and vibrant. He is very confusing due to his mood changes and multiple personalities, but in every personality, he prefers for things to be organized but also colourful and stylish.

                        <b><u>Update on character:</u></b>

                        <br>

                        Jozi is now living in the modern day Johannesburg instead of Joburg during it's glory days and the gold rush and such. He is a spirit that can enter the citizens of Johannesburg's bodies and experience their daily lives. This allows him to reflect on himself, as a city, through the eyes of its most important factor, the people. This also takes him on many adventures and helps him understand the diversity of his people.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This being said he is no longer a physical being, in the business man I initially had thought out, but is rather just a spirit that can physically interact with his environment and it's people. He has a charming, joking personality and is well educated. He is a little bit judgemental but never overly serious about his judgements.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I've decided upon this change to make writing blogs from Jozi's point of view a lot easier and I feel like during these current times it provides more content to write about. It also opens my webpage up to being more relaxed and funny and more for the enjoyment of others and my own fun in creating it.
