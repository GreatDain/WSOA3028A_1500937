                    Through the ages of the browser wars - 18.02.2020

                    <h3> 
                        The First Browser War (Netscape vs Internet Explorer)            
                    </h3>
                        <p>
                            1994, the war begins. Netscape and Internet Explorer begin their fight for supremacy in the First Browser Wars during a time when the world wide web and internet were becoming popular around the globe.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In 1995, Netscape was the most popular web browser on the internet with Internet Explorer coming into the market as the underdog. Like all browsers to date, Netscape and Explorer were modelled after NCSA Mosaic, the first multimedia browser that utilized a graphical user interface allowing for access to multiple sources of media. Netscape, having been in the development process for a longer period, had the advantage of Explorer. But Internet Explorer had the advantage in the sheer magnitude of people using Windows devices allowing Microsoft to make Internet Explorer the default browser for all Windows devices and giving people this access free of charge. This would ultimately lead to Internet Explorer to win the browser wars and put Netscape “out of business”, for the time being, due to the massive difference in financial resources and lack of usage with Explorer being most people’s default browser. Internet Explorer was the basically the only browser around the world and had roughly a 96% share from the early to mid-2000’s.

                        <p>
                            In 2004, Netscape entrusted their technology to a non-profit organization called Mozilla. This would lead us into what was the Second Browser War. Mozilla released a browser called Firefox which ignited the fires of the browser wars once more.
                        </p>

                    <h3>
                        The Second Browser War
                    </h3>
                        <p>
                            The creation of Firefox created trouble for Internet Explorer who remained dominant and unchallenged for quite some time. Due to their long reign as the almighty browser, Microsoft developers offered little to no improvements to their users and this led to an uprising from users who were fed up with their lack of upgrades throughout the years. Many users turned to the Firefox and this caused a rapid growth in the popularity and market share of Firefox. From their release to around 2010 Firefox grew in popularity to hold a steady 20-30% of the market. But Firefox was not the only browser to enter the battlefield this time around.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Apple and Google, two of the world’s giant companies, both entered the browser wars by creating Safari and Google Chrome respectively. Apple, with their already massive and growing popularity made their browser the default for all Apple devices, which was a sure-fire way to increase its popularity and growth. Google, the dominant search engine of the world, used this and their large financial marketing budget to push users towards using Google Chrome. Google Chrome also implemented a fast, iterative development cycle to show users they would continue to develop and improve to give the user the exact user experience and apps they desire.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In the mid to late 2000’s Google Chrome became the dominant browser of the world, ousting all their competitors, including Internet Explorer. 
                        </p>
                            
                        <p>
                            I guess the second browser war could still be considered as ongoing as all browsers are remaining competitive with each other, but Google Chrome still holds the edge in terms of security, their sheer number of apps and extensions, and their synced accounts across all devices.
