                    Semantic Markup - 25.02.2020
                </h1>
                    <p>
                        Using words semantically means using words in the correct context aligning with the meaning of those words, so semantic markup is quite literally using HTML tags that convey some information about the content to follow. It is also for the purpose of dividing content to keep it neat and presentable.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        HTML tags, when used semantically, are a way of telling the web browser, or device about the meaning of the content. This makes it both machine and human-readable. Semantic use of HTML tags/elements are a way of enhancing and making the website more accessible to users on a global scale and to all web browsers. Semantic markup becomes the website and developers desire to communicate with the world.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        There is a semantic tag available for most specific cases, but there are some that are used as a general non-semantic element. If there is an appropriate tag, it should be used. Its main role is to convey meaning and thus using non-semantics when an appropriate tag exists for your purposes can cause problems with search engines and browsers down the line.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        As I see it, semantic markup is like writing an essay about something important to oneself. The way one would write a detailed report about an important creation one has made is the same as how html should be written when creating a web page. It is the very core of the website and as such if it doesn’t make sense, the website shouldn’t make sense when visited by other people and robots around the world.
