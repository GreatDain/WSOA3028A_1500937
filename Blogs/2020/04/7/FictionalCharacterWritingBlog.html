                    My first experiences with fictional blog writing and character development. - 07.04.2020
                </h2>

                <p>
                    What exactly is a blog? A blog is a website that focuses on developer or character written content. Blogs are often personal but can we about any topic imaginable. There is often a connection between the content creator and the readers or audience through a comments section that allows for there to be an interaction and allows for like-minded people to share their ideas and thoughts.

                <p>
                    This definition of a blog has made it difficult, for me personally, to write blogs for a fictional character. I generally understand blogs to be a person’s story and knowledge of life experiences and the world. That being said, it is quite a task to create written content about a character that does not physically exist and to create memories, personality and life experiences that are completely made up. I have a newfound respect for fictional authors/writers and their ability to create such detailed characters out of nothing. It’s like giving birth to a child and being able to see its entire lifespan up to a point in almost an instant and then slowly building that child to do and experience everything you want. Writing fiction seems like a god simulator.

                <p>
                    I am not the most creative person when it comes to these types of things, so I’ve been struggling to develop my character. Deciding the basic information was the easy part but fleshing it out and writing from a completely different point of view and mindset is a challenge. I am trying my best to come up with content and experiences for the character through the voices of the people I know. Hopefully this method will assist me in developing my character further and make it easier to write character blog posts. We’ll have to wait and see what comes of it. I will keep you updated on the progress.
