                <h2>
                    Close Reading of “Towards a study of information geographies: (im)mutable augmentations and a mapping of the geographies of information”.
                </h2>
                
                <p>
                    Information geography is the existence of information in the physical world. Where this information is found, stored, and created shapes how different parts of the world are understood. Information exists in a material place and is ever evolving and being shaped at that specific location. They start by speaking about space and place and how different groups of people across the globe are trying to impose their narratives of informational augmentations. Who are these people? Why are they the “dominant” force that speaks for others?
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    Information in a representation of power and control. Since the pre-digital age only few people had access to information thus collecting masses of data was an extremely rare thing. This meant that countries who could obtain more information had a certain level of control and power over others with very little. This is shown in the uneven distribution of information during that time that led to the “power houses” of those times. These constraints of information of places and the geographical location of information meant the dominant were the ones speaking out and telling the world what was. Essentially, the “Narrator”.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Even during this so called “Information Age”, there is uneven access and distribution of information and communication. This in turn is causing for there to be a similar spread of participation and contribution of information. This imbalance is causing there to be an amplification and reinforcement of the geographical information divide due to historical hierarchy. This juxtaposes the internet and the information age that should, in my opinion, create a solution to this uneven access of information.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Going back to information existing, somewhere, would mean that the representation of information matters. Who represents the information, what is being represented and how it is represented. Information – about people, places, experiences, etc. - that is invisible in representation become invisible in the practical. This is shown using an example of a restaurant being omitted from maps would simply cease to exist if nobody were to find it. This would mean that any information not given is basically non-existent, and that if false information were given to the unknowing, that false information would essentially become actuality until proven otherwise. This raises a few questions, who speaks and who is spoken about/to, and is this possibly the democratising or access and representation in the modern spread of geological access to information?
                </p>

                <p>
                    To answer these questions research was divided into three categories:
                    
                    <li class="bullet"> geographies of access and enablement </li>
                    <li class="bullet"> geographies of participation </li>
                    <li class="bullet"> geographies of representation </li>
                </p>

                <h3>
                    Access and enablement - where, why and who can? 
                </h3>

                <p> 
                    Internet access is highlighted as the dominant concern of information geographies. From the research we can see that the highest concentration of internet users are found in China (half a billion users) followed by the United States of America, India, and Japan. This clearly shows that much of Northern America and Europe have a high number of internet users as well as a high level of internet penetration. Asia was found to have a low internet penetration considering it’s high number of internet users. In the case of Africa, both the internet users and internet penetration are low and almost none existent in comparison to the rest of the world. Africa does however have a high growth in some countries. This goes to show that although the internet is supposed to, and does in some parts, play such a massive part in providing access to information to the world, most of the planet is still without such access.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The affordability of broadband internet relative to the gross national income per capita is then explored. We can see that the Europe and North America have a low relative cost in contrast to the rest of the world, even though their absolute cost value is quite high. The cost of internet in Africa is shown to go up to 250% of the average income, whereas the Americas and Europe can get access for less than around 10% of the average income. This number is getting much better in Africa due to more cables being run around the continent but it is still high due to the average income being so low across the continent. 
                </p>

                <h3>
                    Participation and Contribution – Who does?
                </h3>

                <p>
                    The finding above of the spread of access due to affordability and users shows that participation in representation are impossible for the many without access. With this in mind, geographies of participation are observed. Three variables are explored:
                </p>

                <li class="bullet">
                    Domain names
                    
                    <p>
                        If we look at the world at what information exists on the internet and where they come from, the world map changes significantly. We see that the world would consist mainly of the United States and Europe, and the African continent would basically almost cease to exist. This is due to the sheer number of websites created from these countries. This shows that even though there is a massive difference in the access to the internet, there is an even bigger difference to the amount of contributions to the internet. It also proves that the amount of internet users does is not connected to the extent of production of the domain name measurements. 
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li class="bullet">
                    Github users

                    <p>
                        This was a study of the number of Github users compared to the number of commits of said users. The findings further reinforces the skewed nature of production. The comparison of contribution rate to user rate is higher in North America and Europe (US and UK), and lower in other parts of the world – this is based on Githubs user % vs commits %. This tells us who speaks and represents, and to whom. This means that countries who are not producing and contributing to development are consuming what others are creating instead.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li class="bullet">
                    Wikipedia edits

                    <p>
                        The Wikipedia edits study tracked and recorded the number of edits about a county that came from the users within that country (only for the English language edits). This would answer the question of who is controlling the narrative about themselves? Through the findings we see that even predominantly English-speaking language nations still have a small percentage of articles written about themselves, meaning that majority of the information written about a country was produced elsewhere. This shows that the north has a large participation and content creation while the south is significantly lower, with Africa having almost no production at all in comparison. This means that many countries are taking in and hearing foreign peoples narratives about themselves.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <h3>
                    Representation – Who is?
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Again, three variables were explored: Google Search, OpenStreetMap and Semantic Web by Freebase.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Google search is the world’s most used search engine and as such the data it contains has a significant impact on the representation of places. The data shows the number of webpages per internet user per country. The data is a simple search for mentions of each country’s name (including commonly used names and acronyms for countries) in up to 23 languages. After analysis of the results are as follows: United States has the most mentions, followed by Japan, China and the United Kingdom. This shows a high correlation between the high user numbers and participation, and the amount of representation of countries.
                </p>

                <p>
                    OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a free, open source base map for digital platforms and services, this means they have lots of information about many parts of the world. It is shown that five countries alone comprise 58% of all OSM content. The United States alone hosts 21% of all nodes in OSM. Africa and Latin America are represented by less than 5% of all content in OSM. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Freebase and GeoNames are two semantic web databases that feed data into search engines and various applications. Over 43 million entities of which were collected from Freebase. From this almost 500000 place names were identified, most of which were concentrated in North America and Europe, with the United States holding 45% of the total place names. This demonstrates the consistent pattern of unevenness throughout the web and different platforms of representation. 
                </p>

                <h3>
                    What does all this mean?
                </h3>

                <p>
                    The information and discoveries made in Towards a study of information geographies begins to show the true imbalance of the world’s information era. It highlights the consistency of key patterns of unevenness in access, representation, and contribution and how they could be related. It shows us that the digital divide is much worse than we thought and emphasises how little access the entire world has. Majority of the world is without access and those who do have access are generally being represented by the North, with the South having significantly less access and representation even with the little access across the world. This proves that things could only get worse over time and that the divide is growing exponentially worse. We are in a world where changing who is producing and speaking about anything in particular is becoming increasingly more complex and if we don’t begin to find a means of creating a balance the results could become potentially irreversible.
