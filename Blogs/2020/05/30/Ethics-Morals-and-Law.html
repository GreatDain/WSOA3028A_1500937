                <h2>
                    Ethics, Morals and the Law – The difference between in programming
                </h2>

                <p>
                    Ethics is the factors (values and principles) that determine one’s process of decision making. Values and principles are what defines what is good and right in our lives. They are the basis for the actions we choose to take. Everyone can reflect on a situation and decide on what is the good, right course of action to take. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Morality is generally inherited by family, community, culture, and/or religious beliefs. Having tried and tested methods that can be used every day. This way of life is almost ingrained in the person and can to a certain extent have effect on a person’s ethics, but it is often subconscious.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The law is neither ethics nor morals, it is simply a set of rules that defines a space in which people can live by their own ethical and moral beliefs. It is almost like a generalized standard of how people should behave to allow for a thriving community or nation where different ethics and morals can be treated and seen on an equal footing. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b> How do all these fit into the life of a programmer? 
                    </b>
                </p>

                <p>
                    There have been many cases in history of abused and illegal programming practices. The company is almost always held legally responsible for the decisions made, as they should be, but programmers also often find themselves involved. This then raises the question of whether the programmer should also be held responsible for a company’s decision making if it seems to be illegitimate and illegal. How should developers react to unethical or illegal requests by their employers? 
                </p>

                <p>
                    This leaves developers with difficult decisions to make. Speaking out against an employer is a difficult thing to do especially considering it will have on effect on oneself, becoming unemployed, but if much research was done on the topic and the request is illegitimate, and/or does not align with one’s personal values then speaking out is the right thing to do. Speaking to the employer first to make it known to them what is wrong about it. If the employer does not budge, then one should definitely take action and speak to a trusted legal advisor on how to go about things.
                </p>

                <p>
                    With the number of programmers in the world currently, many are willing to just follow along with what the company’s decisions are, even if it conflicts with their own ethics and morals. This is out of fear for their jobs and a stable source of income. It is also thought to be only the company’s responsibility and that the developer is just following his/her legal contract, but it doesn’t always work that way when the law strikes down on the company. Programmers can be seen as an accomplice and face jail time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This topic has and will probably always be a heavily debated subject as people try to find where the line is drawn. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    All this being said there is not correct answer, and everything above is strictly my own opinion of what programmers should do.
