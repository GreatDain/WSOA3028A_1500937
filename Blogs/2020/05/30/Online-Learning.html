                <h1>
                    Online Learning, the future of education?
                </h1>

                <p>
                    With the corona virus epidemic taking the world into a new era it is only natural for education, on a global scale, to move onto online platforms, at least for the time being. How should educational institutions approach online learning to get the most out of its students and educators? 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Student motivation is probably at an all time low due to covid-19. Everyone is being mentally and emotionally taxed by this pandemic and it is causing students and most probably educators to experience new kind of stress and pressure. Educators are unsure of how to keep students involved without them physically being in class, and students are struggling to find a drive to push them to do the work at home and understand the work fully. I think it is a lot more difficult to process and understand the content of work through either live stream lectures or recordings, there are too many distractions and a sort of “Do I need to do this while the world is basically falling apart?” thought process. This being said, how can online teaching methods be improved to keep students from being distracted by the world around them and keep them focused on their education?
                </p>

                <p>
                    First and foremost, I think it is important to create a supportive learning environment. Creating a more friendly and trusting work environment rather than the usual distant feel between teachers and students. I think it is important to have both the student and teacher to get to know each other better. This will make students, especially shy students, feel more comfortable approaching the educator and asking questions whether it be during the live stream lecture or through online forums etc. Creating small groups to allow for a better student-to-student support structure could also be important in trying to aid students who might struggle to catch on to key concepts and understanding of content. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Educators should stay in contact with students through multiple platforms to keep them up to date and provide a constant stream of feedback so progression of work is made easier and students can understand exactly where they are going wrong, what to focus on, etc. Using a mix of different learning, social, and learning tools and platforms will encourage more engagement with the work. The world is very tech oriented and students are online in some way or another for probably most of their days, so using platforms that students can access from any of their many devices will make life much simpler. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Making online learning accessible to every student is probably the most important factor. Many students do not have access to technology and internet, especially in Africa. Providing a means for those students to also be involved is crucial to online education. But unfortunately, to do this, educational institutions need lots of funding to provide lesser privileged students the with the required resources. This is not something I can find or discuss a solution to but I just want it to be known that inclusion is one of the most important things in education otherwise we could face a compounded effect of more uneducated people and a higher unemployment and poverty rate.
