                    Tracking mobile phones to curb COVID-19
                </h2>

                <p>
                    The government can now track the spread of covid by monitoring which people an infected individual interacted with by analysing location data.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The South African Minister of Communications, Telecommunications and Postal Service confirmed that the government will track mobile location data of citizens infected by covid-19. They are working in collaboration with cell phone service providers. This data will check how many people an infected person has come into contact with. The government claims that they have the authority to do what needs to be done “to save lives” by collecting and analysing data of citizens. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    South Africa is not the only country using these methods to curb and trace the spread of covid-19. China is relying on mass surveillance of mobile devices to track individuals and assign them a level of access and movement restrictions based on the individual’s health status from the analysis of such mobile data. China is demanding that citizens install a classification software that designates colour codes depending on the citizen’s contagion risk. This would essentially decide which of the population should be quarantined and which are permitted to enter back into public. Other nations like the USA and European nations are opting for a less invasive method by creating specific apps that are designed for tracking covid-19 by using the devices location data. The difference of views of privacy and data collection can be seen in the different approaches taken by some Asian nations, and South Africa, compared to the USA and Europe.

                <p>
                    Disaster Management in South Africa implored a middle ground approach by asking citizens to make compromises and assuring them that the data will not be used to spy on them but were rather preserved in confidential covid-19 tracking data. Due to the history of the government surveillance on activists during the anti-apartheid struggle, citizens are still wary of the decision to track their location data. This storage of such a large amount of sensitive data on a central database poses a massive cybersecurity risk as it is a goldmine for hackers across the globe.

                <p>
                    Although the idea behind this tracing of location data is meant for a good cause in trying to slow down this pandemic it could potentially give rise to further government snooping later. The unsettling pace of the pandemic could be empowering governments to establish digital surveillance structures in pursuit of their own interest. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    As the entire globe struggles against the rapidly growing pandemic, various countries have found it necessary to resort to the use of surveillance tools and telecommunications to ensure the spread of the virus is reduced. Several mobile applications have been created to use a phones location data as well as Bluetooth technology to employ social control. This has given rise to concerns of this new ‘legal’ form of spying causing a repeat of historical struggles and cases of government snooping, but on a global scale. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, for now, the South African government has assured the public that the Covid-19 Tracing Database will be used only for the preservation of life, however I believe that citizens should remain vigilant as we have all found ourselves living in an era where there is little, to no, public trust with regards to the privacy of our data.
