                <h2>
                    Neumorphism and Skeuomorphism in UI
                </h2>

                <p>
                    Skeuomorphism is the design of a user interface that mimics how that/those specific objects function in real life. This can be done by mimicking the way it looks, sounds and by using concepts that the user will recognise. By using familiar objects and concepts the designer can convey to the user how that specific thing should be used. Buttons were, and are still in some cases, designed with a slightly glossy look to mimic those of the real world, making the use of it intuitive to the user. But, in the modern society people have become so accustomed to interacting with UI that it seems to not need to be made to mimic the real world. So, in recent times, skeuomorphism seems to be less common than it used to be. Graphic designers are also using neumorphism as an alternative and newer approach to the user interface.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Neumorphism, or neumorphic design, is in my opinion, the simplified version of skeuomorphism. It is the design to make objects look as if they extrude from their backgrounds instead of float above the background. This is achieved by playing with the shadows of both the object and the background, both of which need to be the same colour. By making the background slightly darker or lighter than the object the object will see to be extruded from the background. This will ensure that both light and dark shadows can be visible on the same object. With this design comes a problem of visibility and accessibility. The background and object being the same colours means there is less of a contrast. This leads to their needing to be deeper thought into the use of typography. By giving the icons and writing a high enough contrast, or different state shading or colour, to the object and the background the accessibility issue could be helped.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I have chosen to attempt to use a neumorphic approach to this website to further explore the issues that come from the design approach and to dig deeper into accessibility and how it can be improved, not just in neomorphism but in other things like game development and the likes as well.
