                    IBM to abandon facial recognition software and technology in a step towards ‘algorithmic justice’.
                </h2>

                <p>
                    CEO Arvind Krishna said, in a letter to members of congress, that there is a potential for police to use facial recognition to violate “basic human rights and freedoms” at that they have come to the decision to end all research and development of such technologies. This decision was made in light of the Black Lives Matter movement in addition to the years of criticism over creation of such technology that violates human rights and privacy due to the accuracy of the technology, cause of racial profiling and creation of mass surveillance.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This move by IBM allowed for other companies to follow suit. Amazon and Microsoft also declared their suspension of police use of facial recognition software and the suspension of sales of such tech to any law enforcement agencies. IBM will, however, continue to use and produce other recognition technologies for things such as facial scanning to authenticate devices and airport security staff finding abandoned luggage.

                <p>
                    In 2018, A massive issue from research was revealed in that the facial recognition software developed by IBM, Microsoft and Face++ misidentify people of colour more often than white people. It also misidentifies women more often than men.

                <p>
                    Even with people calling facial recognition software for surveillance a violation of human rights law enforcement agencies is saying the technology serves as a powerful tool to quickly identifying criminals. Despite this IBM have joined the Algorithmic Justice League in their attempt to prove the tech cannot be reformed. IBM expressed their support for the Justice in Policing Act of 2020 to work towards reforming the police, create responsible technologies and educational opportunities and training for people of colour.

                <p>
                    This is another step towards a new movement to bring an end to police brutality, holding law enforcement agencies and officers accountable for their actions, and creating a transparency between the police and the public it serves to protect. This would probably have never been done if it weren’t for George Floyd. May he rest in peace and look upon a changed world from his resting place.
