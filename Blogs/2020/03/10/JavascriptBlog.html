                    Javascript, The "Yes Man" of programming languages - 10.03.2020
                </h1>

                <p>
                    Over the past week we have been taught the basics of the Javascript programming language for the purposes of creating this very website you’re reading the blog on. Here is a summary of my understanding of what was learned.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Javascript is a dynamic and interpretive language. This allows programmers to not have to define their types upfront as java will figure stuff out later. As far as I understand, Java technically does compile but it doesn’t compile when built, rather it does this when the code is executed. This means that Java both compiles and executes on other machines that run the code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are only 8 types in Javascript, and this differentiates it from almost every other coding language. Java figures out the best possible type for what you give it and executes based on its understanding of the given information. Therefore, there are some patterns that we veer away from because of the way it operates. Java is asynchronous and this allows it to execute things much faster than other languages and this is important from the user’s perspective.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In class we created some examples of functions in and were taught some applications in Javascript. We had created what would be considered a class in most other programming languages but found out that java treats the class like a normal function, with some slight differences from regular functions. It was found that we can directly manipulate and add or remove items from our function without needing to define them previously. Java was compared to a friend that allows says “yeah sure, I can do that for you”. Javascript is provides the coding freedom that others prevent by allowing you to do almost anything you want. We learned about manipulating functions and objects. We also learned about arrays and that they are what we know them to be in other languages but in my understanding, from the example done in class, act more like vectors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Javascript to me is a language of expression and creativity and allows the programmer to do a lot more than usual. It allows previously impossible acts of programming principles and practice to be implemented and still work the way you planned. It is the best friend every programmer needs in programming life.
