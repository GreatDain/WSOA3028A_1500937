                    So, here’s my story about today. It all started at 1pm, my spirit got zapped across the city and into the heart of Sandton. The office I found myself in was quite fancy. Glass desk, black leather couches, large stocked bookshelf, whiskey on a side table next to a seat overlooking Sandton through large glass office windows. There were many awards and fancy paintings on the walls. It was pretty impressive. All fancy things aside, something felt strange, it felt like a weight was being lifted, and it was, quite literally being lifted. A giant gut appeared in my peripherals as I stood up, apparently this was mine for today. Two thoughts popped into my mind, “please let me be a pregnant lady” and “please don’t be a fat guy”. The boobs were there, the belly was there, but so was the beard… I was indeed in the body of a fat guy.

                    It was the most unusually shaped body. If I were to describe it, it would probably be a pencil stuck through an apple or something of the sort. Today I was a fat guy. This guy had kinda skinny limbs and a fat belly (aka beer boop). He had apparently just devoured an entire bucket of KFC chicken… I’ve never felt so full in my life. We headed out of the office, down a nicely carpeted hallway, one floor down an elevator and straight to the bathroom. I’d rather not write about what I experienced next, but I can say that I will never be able to unsee it (plumbers, lord have mercy on your souls). He checked himself in the mirror while washing his hands… On top of being fat, I was also old... and grey. At least I had a full head of hair, good for this guy! I had just assumed the back pain was from the heavy lifting, but I guess it was a combination of weight and old bones. I had only one thought, “Please let this end soon!”…
