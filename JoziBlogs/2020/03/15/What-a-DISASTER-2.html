                    We made it to the Gautrain station and walk to towards the platform. The schedule reads “Midrand -20mins”, I’m definitely going to be late. There were many spaces available on the benches, but we sit on a step instead. I will admit, those benches are badly designed, it’s hard not to slowly slide off them. People pass by, some in a hurry, some laid back and relaxed, most dressed in business attire. Some try to talk to us, so we put our earphones in and pretend like they don’t exist. 20 minutes pass by slowly and the train finally arrives.

                    The train is clean, as always, it’s rare to see people keeping things clean in this city. We walk towards a quiet spot on the train and find ourselves a window seat, like usual. She flicks through her music playlists to Shawn Mendes, Play. The train ride becomes a blur and we suddenly hear our “Midrand Station” over the intercom as the train pulls into the station. We bolt out of the train, “why are we in such a rush?” is what I thought to myself. “I need to hurry, the bus is gonna leave soon”, I guess that answers my question. It was almost like she knew I was there. In keeping with what seems like the theme for today, we run up the seemingly endless loop of escalators like a crazy person and make it just in time for the bus. It is pretty much empty. “I need to get a car soon”.

                    We sift through contacts on Whatsapp, messaging everyone so they know we are alive… or that she is alive. Her mom called so many times already. The bus arrives, luckily campus is just across the road. What a surprise, the pedestrian button isnt working again, they really need to fix these things. We’ve made it to University, a little bit late, but it couldve been worse. We’re hot and sweaty but at least we made it…
