                    I’ve woken up to a pile of hair in my face. It’s a bit dry. I have the urge to stay in bed, but I also desperately need the bathroom. 15 minutes in and I’m still in bed but my alarm is giving me a headache, so I eventually wake up. Bathroom duties occur as per usual. I brush my teeth and look in the mirror. I’m a 20-year-old girl, apparently… Wait, am I?... My reflection in the mirror looks like a boy, but my body parts say otherwise. So, I’m a confused 20-year-old girl lol.

                    We make our way to the kitchen for breakfast, we’ve forgotten to do the dishes last night… whoops, guess we’ll leave it for later. We jam a quick a breakfast in while watching an episode of The Bachelor. It is 9am. Crap we’re late for class! Lots of shuffling, banging cupboards, makeup everywhere, burning smell? (Oh no! That’s the hair straightener!), ransacked room, tripped and hit my head, but we’ve found something to wear. Cool. We head out the front door.

                    SHIT! SHIT! SHIIIIT! Everything is falling apart… our life feels like it’s about to end, and by `our’ I mean `her’. I look like a train-wreck and my bag is unpacking itself... We’re so over this! We’re in fancy sports car, but the driver is a snail… he’s her dad, by the way. 94.7 or Five? Neither apparently, dad doesn’t want to listen to music, he wants to talk. Many blahs later, as we approach the train station, my eyes leave Instagram to see my train on its merry way. Guess I’ll be late, again…
